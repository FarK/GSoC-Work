# Work Product

I have tried to organize all my contributions to the Netfilter project along the
GSoC in this little web.

### Main features
I have developed three main new features, for the user space tool nftables and
the library libnftnl. You can see a description and its commits in corresponding
subpage:

* [Rule deletion by description](rule-deletion.md)
* [TLV infrastructure for user data](tlv-infrastructure.md)
* [Rule replacement](rule-replacement.md)

### Small features and bugs fixes
I also have developed some small features and fixed several bugs. You can take a
look in these links:

* [Small features](small-features.md)
* [Fixes](fixes.md)

### All commits
At this page you can access to a list of all my commits sorted by
repository:

* [List of commits](commits.md)

### Project activity

You can get an impression about my activity into the project glancing the
[project patchwork](http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/list/?submitter=66988&state=*)
